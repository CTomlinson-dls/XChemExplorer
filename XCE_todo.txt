DONE - Data Source: capture ligand confidence and other Model table things
- datasource2scarab script
- settings: 2fofc & fofc sigma level; show EVENT maps (yes/no)
- SQLite operational error: database is locked

- DLS: submission of array jobs to cluster
- reference mtz files with other column names: e.g. F-obs...

- ligand pdb/png/cif files: ignore if already present

- PANDDA models
  -> Nick: script which extracts bound and unbound state
  -> pdb file of bound is read in 

- ALBULA problem at Dmd; Nick?

- Dimple Phase column names changed from 2ffc to FWT…

- mmtbx commandline tools for validation

- PANDDA validation:
   * fofc maps: before/ after ligand was modelled
   * event maps
   * B-factor distribution
   * bound conformation
   * 2fofc maps
   * ligand model (before/ after refinement); did it move?
   ==> bundle everything in a kind of pandda.validate script

- reorganize XCE to better reflect actual workflow
- put DLS @ data collection in one tab, then add subtabs for details and summary
- read data processing module: make more generic:
  (so that programmer can preconfigure)
  * path to logfile
  * path to merged mtzfile
  * path to unmerged mtzfile
  * path to cystal snapshots

- 'create data source' button in settings tab
- block everything as long as data source is not assigned (maybe some color coding)

- deposition tab: one subtab to provide stuff like authors etc; can be saved in file

- further columns in data source: 
	Pandda was run: true/false
	Pandda hit
	Pandda hit near site of interest: true/ false

- Run pandda when maps already exist, what's the best mechanism?

- add at some point XChemScripts and XChemHelp libraries

DONE - 'Update Datasource': overwrites fields with empty entry: e.g. in case logfiles are in one directory, but only subset of all samples was refined in another directory

- DLS visit (09/02/2016)
	- show texrank crystal images alongside diffraction images; maybe add additional tab
	- single dls main tab (then 3 subtabs [see above])
	- create datasource: doesn't work if pressed after other folders were selected; 
	   probably because data source was set to true somewhere
	- Alice: get sqlite file: crystals which are soaked but not mounted are displayed
	         (that's OK, but how does XCE deal with it)
	DONE - Update reference folder is buggy, if it has already set something, it doesn't update the list; 
	         check line877; essentially re-assigning other reference file does not work
	DONEish- Select Columns might be nice to have; with the possibility to update the datasource
	- Sorting odd when xtal numbers are like x3 x45 etc
	- create cif/pdb/png: Empty samples create compound folder in initial model folder when sample is empty
	- Dataset summary not properly shown at dls; maybe datasource is not updated properly

- detect misaligned crystals: add analyse menu to XCE; try detecting my calculating standard deviation of Rmerge per frame from mean Rmerge?!

- SQLite file is read-only: issue warning message
- phenix validation -> move to cctbx

- allowed unit cell difference in settings must be integer at the moment, otherwise XCE barfs

- things like 'suggest additional crystal form' are really slow, because it queries the filesystem, but it probably should ask the data source
  -> update data source should be the only point where it does this?

XCE @ feedback

Alice, 04/03/2016

DLS @ summary is great for that!
-	1 single page with all the experiments from all possible visits with views of the crystals + stats and diffraction images is great!
-	Could change the ‘failed’ annotation quickly with the middle mouse wheel and the updates go back to DLS @ Data collection!

Things maybe to add/improve/ questions I have:
-	Add ‘Failed: loop broken’ (most of the ‘failed’ for me).Minor
-	Remove puck and position (since they won’t be used) and maybe slightly bigger image of crystals? I couldn’t see empty loops so well . minor
-	Sorting of the crystals identifiers. It is not really doing it by ascending or descending number currently. Major. Annoying.
-	Is it possible to sort by failed or success? And then export as csv?
    Solution: export csv only? For what purpose?
-	If I now save it to database, it should keep my change (for the annotation), shouldn’t it?
	Solution: record every change in data_collection_dict and autosave every 60s
	          idea is to save to database only when files are copied to disc
